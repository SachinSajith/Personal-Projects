# Personal Data Projects

Welcome to my repository of personal projects showcasing my expertise in data cleaning, preparation, analysis, and visualization. Here, you'll find various projects where I've leveraged the power of SQL, Python, and its popular libraries—pandas, NumPy, and Seabird—alongside Tableau to derive insightful conclusions from diverse datasets.

## Overview

This repository includes projects where I employ:
- **SQL**: For querying and managing database operations.
- **Python**: Utilized as the main programming language.
- **Pandas and NumPy**: For data manipulation and numerical analysis.
- **Seabird**: Specifically used in projects involving environmental data processing.
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive and compelling visualizations.
